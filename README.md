# HPSA-Cleanup
Project to clean up the HPSA (Health Professional Shortage Area) primary care data set. Source: data.hrsa.gov

* Note that the original data set is too large of a file to upload. 
You can find the original data set at https://data.hrsa.gov//DataDownload/DD_Files/BCD_HPSA_FCT_DET_PC.csv 

Updated missing data, formatted dates, modified columns and rows to have correct data types. Removed special characters and inconsistent formatting of strings.

Created a view to show the health professional shortage areas by highest shortage (number of FTEs needed to meet provider-population ratio goals). 
See data dictionary file for all column definitions.
